Flavour Network and the Principles of Food Pairing

Food pairing is an interesting area of research, concerning which ingredient goes with which for getting an optimally like-able taste. Creating a flavor network enables us to study these pairings and their contribution in cuisine, whether gourmet or otherwise. Flavour networks have been used to suggest new recipes and discover new food pairings such as chocolate and blue cheese, based on the fact that they are very connected by the compounds present in them. Such studies have also gained considerable commercial success, leading to more avenues of building new recipes.
In view of this, Barabasi had first studied such flavour networks, highlighting how Western cuisine tends to make similar tasting compounds their choice and utilise these in their recipes and how East Asian cuisine tends to utilise varied compounds for achieving different tastes. This highlighted major differences in how cuisine was prepared in such cultures.
In summary, our analysis tries to identify the significant patterns that characterize the way humans choose which ingredients they combine in their food.
We attempt to replicate the study and draw on it further specifically for Indian cuisine and East Asian cuisines.
